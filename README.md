# EggDeposition

Coregonus hoyi, otherwise called the bloater, is a species or type of freshwater whitefish in the family
Salmonidae. It is a shimmering shaded herring-like fish, 25.5 centimeters (10.0 in) long. It is found in the
greater part of the Great Lakes and in Lake Nipigon, and inhabits underwater slopes.
The aim of this experiment is to analyse how the egg deposition of age-3 lake huron Bloaters has changed
from 1981 to 1996 and to predict the changes in egg depositions for next 5 years using best model for the
given data. The data for our analysis is taken from FSAdata library which has the Egg count in millions from 1981 to 1996.
